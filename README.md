```lrc
[00:13.67] I want to live the life I dream
[00:17.03] Reach the skies if I believe
[00:20.42] Even if the past has left me broken
[00:37.92] 
[00:27.16] Oh I promise to change
[00:30.65] For myself and my mistakes
[00:34.39] Live for the day
[00:37.46] When I make em' proud
[00:47.96] 
[00:40.60] Oh I promise to change
[00:43.82] For myself and my mistakes
[00:47.68] Live for the day
[00:50.43] When I make em' proud
[01:00.93] 
[01:19.88] Always moving to the sound
[01:23.36] Hoping that I'll make it out
[01:26.74] Crying as I leave familiar faces
[01:42.74] 
[01:32.98] So never run from the life you breathe
[01:36.48] Hold it up: your legacy
[01:39.85] Knowing that you're always gonna make it
[01:59.85] 
[01:46.77] Oh I promise to change
[01:50.07] For myself and my mistakes
[01:53.76] Live for the day
[01:56.86] When I make em' proud
[02:07.36] 
[01:59.83] Oh I promise to change
[02:03.29] For myself and my mistakes
[02:06.93] Live for the day
[02:09.85] When I make em' proud
